#Challenge 1
#What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the following program?
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
print(c(mass, age))

#Challenge 2
#Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to compare mass to age. 
#Is mass larger than age?
mass > age  #yes, prints as TRUE

#Challenge 3
#Clean up your working environment by deleting the mass and age variables.
rm(list = c("mass","age"))  #removes multiple varibles at once
mass <- 47.5

#Challenge 4
#Install the following packages: ggplot2, plyr, gapminder
#ggplot2, plyr already installed
#install.packages(c("ggplot2","plyr","gapminder"))
install.packages("gapminder")
library("gapminder")
